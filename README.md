# Movie-revenue-prediction-and-recommendation-system

This is a project in module CZ1115 Introduction to data science and artificial intelligent of Nanyang Technological University

In this project, we create a regression model to predict revenue base on controllable elements (elements that the producer can adjust before the movie is released) and uncontrollable elements (elements that are arised after the movie is released).

Besides, we also create a recommendation system based on content. 

All the dataset, script and video are attached in this repository.
